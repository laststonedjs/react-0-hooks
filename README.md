# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## CSS Styles

- For index.css, I just copy and paste the CSS from Primitive, a simple CSS boilerplate I made, as the point of this app is to work on React and not care about design. This CSS boilerplate just adds some sensible defaults and a simple grid so we can start prototyping.
