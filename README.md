# React-O-Hooks

---
## CRUD App built with React
---

## Goals

### Through this repo, I plan to build some kind of CRUD application in React, using and emphazinig react hooks.

### It will have users, and you'll be able to add, update, or delete users. We won't use any React classes, and instead we'll utilize State Hooks and Effect Hooks on functional components.


## HOW TO START THE APP
=======
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


## CSS Styles

- For index.css, I just copy and paste the CSS from Primitive, a simple CSS boilerplate I made, as the point of this app is to work on React and not care about design. This CSS boilerplate just adds some sensible defaults and a simple grid so we can start prototyping.
